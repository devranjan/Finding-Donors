# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML
My first project submission for "Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree Program"

**Tools used in this project:**

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn
- Anaconda ( Jupyter Notebook)

**Data**

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper "Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid", by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf) , with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
